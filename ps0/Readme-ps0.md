# PS0: Hello SFML

## Contact
Name:William Chikere Nosike

Section: COMP 2040 P 1 201

Time to Complete: 96 hours 


## Description
Explain what the project is supposed to do: The project is supposed to show how a sprite can be manipulated. From what saw on the internet Sfml is used in most video games like most of the mario games and 2d games. So in that case why not make a simple mini game 
I Made a simple mini Game which if it had a name it will be called aura farming. its a simple game where the character or in this case a sprite moves left and right and interacts with door that sends the sprite back to its initial position masking the illusion that it has moved to other location .After that action has happened an enemy png spawns after 3seconds and the goal is not move, if sprite moves players health reduces. the sprite after touching the door also gains the ability to go up and down 

### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.
i made the decision to make this mini game because it was the first idea i had in mind and the sprite picture represent a game i just finished called bloodborne which is on the and Paysation 4  . i saw alot of 2d art for the game so i decided it should get a 2d version.

### Extra Feature
Describe anything special you did.  This is required to earn points.
some extra features i added is  1.health bar, 2.Keystorke reward system which i am guessing is not special. 3.The door disappearing after sprite comes in contact with it. 4.The health draining mechanic which drains health bar if you move. 4.Spawning enemy after 3 seconds 5. another feature is if the sprite goes to the enemy or touch the enemy the health drains faster 



### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.
Everthing works but the only thing that i dont know if its a problem is the lint. so it  shows  this after the command for the lint (cpplint *.cpp *.hpp)

Skipping input '*.hpp': Can't open for reading
Done processing main.cpp

Other than that the code runs clean when i input make and ./sfml-app

## Integrity
Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:

There are nine examples of academic misconduct, labeled (1) through (9). Other than (1), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words. Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.

the one that i think that applies to this class is the one thats states .... seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation (plagiarism, copying etc) i feel like that really works for the this class. its easy to fall in the trap of coping straight from the internet or from a friend without at least giving credit. Giving the proper citations or acknowledgments when using others work is definitely essential to maintain honesty and integrity
